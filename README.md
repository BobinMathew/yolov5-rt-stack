# ðŸ”¦ Yolov5 Runtime Stack

[![Stable](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/workflows/Stable/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/actions?query=workflow%3AStable) [![Nightly](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/workflows/Nightly/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/actions?query=workflow%3ANightly)

Yet another implementation of Ultralytics's [yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), and with modules refactoring to make it available in the `libtorch`, `onnxruntime` and other backends. *Currently work in process, very pleasure for suggestion and cooperation.*

- [ ] Add more fetures ...

## ðŸ›  Usage

There are something different comparing to [ultralytics's](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/yolo.py) implementation. This repo can load ultralytics's trained model checkpoint with minor modifications, I have converted ultralytics's lastest released [v3.1](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/download/v3.1/yolov5s.pt) checkpoint [here](https://github.com/zhiqwang/yolov5-rt-stack/releases/download/v0.2.1/yolov5s.pt).

You can also convert ultralytics's trained (or your own) model checkpoint with the following command:

```bash
python -m utils.updated_checkpoint [--checkpoint_path ./yolov5s.pt]
                                   [--cfg_path ./models/yolov5s.yaml]
                                   [--updated_checkpoint_path ./checkpoints/yolov5/yolov5s.pt]
```

### âœ¨ PyTorch interface

The `detect.py` reads a image source and does inference.

```bash
python -m detect [--model_cfg ./models/yolov5s.yaml]
                 [--input_source YOUR_IMAGE_SOURCE_DIR]
                 [--checkpoint ./checkpoints/yolov5/yolov5s.pt]
                 [--labelmap ./checkpoints/yolov5/coco.names]
                 [--output_dir ./data-bin/output]
                 [--min_size 640]
                 [--max_size 640]
                 [--save_img]
                 [--gpu]  # GPU switch, Set False as default
```

### ðŸš€ LibTorch interface

Here providing an [example](./deployment) of getting `LibTorch` inferencing to work. Also you can check the [CI](.github/workflows/stable.yml) for more details.
